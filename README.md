# armstrong-number-calculator

A program that calculates if a number is an [Armstrong number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_number).

An [Armstrong number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_number) is a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

This project was inspired by the exercise "Armstrong Numbers" on https://exercism.org. Here is a [link](https://exercism.org/tracks/c/exercises/armstrong-numbers) to the exercise page.
